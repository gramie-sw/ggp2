Game Guessing Portal 2
----------------------

Functionally ggp2 is a Rails based prediction game for soccer championships. Pit your strength against your comrades and
earn badges and fame by guessing the winner of each match and predicting the upcoming champion team.

Technically ggp2 acts a showcase and is used to investigate the feasibility of transforming a standard Rails application
into a Domain-Driven software project.
